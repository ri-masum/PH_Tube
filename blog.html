      The scope of a var variable is functional scope and it can be updated and

    <h1 class="text-red-400 text-5xl mt-10">Uses of Null & Undefine</h1>
    <p class="mt-5 flex-wrap text-black font-semibold">
      Null in JavaScript means an empty value and is also a primitive type in
      JavaScript. The variable which has been assigned as null contains no
      value. <br />
      Undefined, on the other hand, means the variable has been declared, but
      its value has not been assigned.

    <h1 class="text-red-400 text-5xl mt-10">Rest API</h1>
    <p class="mt-5 flex-wrap text-black font-semibold">
        An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that 
        define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate 
        with each other. <br>
         A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style. For this reason, REST APIs are sometimes referred to RESTful APIs.
